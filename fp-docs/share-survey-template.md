# Share a survey as a template

It's easy to share a survey as a template so that other people in your organization can duplicate it and use it as their own. When you make a copy of a survey, the copy exists in your profile. When you share a survey as a template, you create a special link that allows others to duplicate the survey in their own profile, where they can make changes to it.

When you share a survey as a template, only the structure of the survey is duplicated. No existing response data is carried over to the new survey.

To share a survey as a template:

1.  Open the survey you want to share.

2. Select the **ellipsis** button (â€¦) from the toolbar at the top of the page, and then select **Share**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![share the survey](media/share-survey.png "Share the survey")

3.  Select **Get a link to duplicate**.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![get the link to share the survey as template](media/get-survey-duplicate-link.png "Get the link to share the survey as a template")  

4.  Select **Copy** next to the text box that displays the survey URL.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![link to share the survey as template](media/survey-duplicate-link.png "Link to share the survey as a template")  

5.  Share this link with your intended audience.

6.  When another person navigates to that survey URL, they must select **Duplicate it** at the top or bottom of the survey to create a copy of the survey in their own profile, which they can then modify for their own needs.
